School project where the goal was to be able to change game or graphical library while playing.

You need to have the SDL2, SFML and NCURSES.

You can change library by pressing 1 or 2.
While in game you can change it by pressing 3 or 4.
In the menu use the arrows to change the game and the keyboard to select your name.
Press SPACE to switch between the menu and the game.
In game use the arrows to move.

Make and use this ./arcade lib/arcade_sfml.so or
             this ./arcade lib/arcade_sdl2.so or
             this ./arcade lib/arcade_ncurses.so
